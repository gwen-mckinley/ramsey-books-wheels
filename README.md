# About this repository
This repository contains code supporting the paper "Small Ramsey numbers for books, wheels, and generalizations" by Bernard Lidick√Ω, Gwen McKinley, and Florian Pfender. This code was used to find the lower bound constructions in the paper for *books* and *wheels*. For code related to the upper bounds, see [https://lidicky.name/pub/gr/](https://lidicky.name/pub/gr/).

## Contents:

* Python code used to find Ramsey lower bound constructions for *books* and *wheels* via tabu search. 
* Constructions from the paper, along the number of steps taken by tabu search to find them, and the random seeds used.
* Examples showing how to verify the constructions using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).

## Usage:

To run the tabu search, download all the files in the "code" folder to a directory, and from that directory, enter the following command:

```
python main.py -n <num_vertices> -b <bad_subgraph> -k <bad_sizes> 
```

For example, to find the adjacency matrix of a 14-vertex graph with no 5-vertex wheels in color 0 and no 7-vertex wheels in color 1, enter the command:

```
python main.py -n 14 -b wheels -k 5 7
```

**Important note:** the parameter ``k`` always refers to the number of *vertices* in the "forbidden subgraph." The wheel $W_k$ has $k$ vertices, but the book $`B_k`$ has $`k+2`$ vertices. So for example, to find an 18-vertex graph with no $`B_4`$ in color 0 and no $`B_5`$ in in color 1, we would enter:

```
python main.py -n 18 -b books -k 6 7
```

For a full list of options (parallel search, random seed, saving the final construction to a file), type:

```
python main.py --help
```
