# About this repository
This repository contains code supporting the paper "Small Ramsey numbers for books, wheels, and generalizations" by Bernard Lidick√Ω, Gwen McKinley, Florian Pfender, and Steven Van Overberghe. This code was used to find lower bound constructions in the paper for *books* and *wheels*, as well as some upper bounds via "bottom-up generation". For code related to the upper bounds found with flag algebras, see [https://lidicky.name/pub/gr/](https://lidicky.name/pub/gr/).

## Contents:

`bottom-up`

* Plugin for `geng` that was used to generate all (B2,B8)-graphs.
* A list of all extremal (W5,W9)-graphs.
* Lists of all (W5,W7)-graphs for every order, in graph6 format.

`polycirculant`
    
* Lower bound constructions coming from polycirculant graphs, specified in graph6 format. For more information on this graph encoding, see: https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html

`tabu`

* Python code used to find Ramsey lower bound constructions for *books* and *wheels* via tabu search. 
* Constructions found using tabu search, along the number of steps taken to find them, and the random seeds used.
* Examples showing how to verify the constructions using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).

## Usage:

To run the tabu search, download all the files in the "code" folder to a directory, and from that directory, enter the following command:

```
python main.py -n <num_vertices> -b <bad_subgraph> -k <bad_sizes> 
```

For example, to find the adjacency matrix of a 17-vertex graph with no 5-vertex wheels in color 0 and no 9-vertex wheels in color 1, enter the command:

```
python main.py -n 17 -b wheels -k 5 9
```

**Important note:** the parameter ``k`` always refers to the number of *vertices* in the "forbidden subgraph." The wheel $W_k$ has $k$ vertices, but the book $B_k$ has $k+2$ vertices. So for example, to find a 20-vertex graph with no $B_2$ in color 0 and no $B_8$ in in color 1, we would enter:

```
python main.py -n 20 -b books -k 4 10
```

For a full list of options (parallel search, random seed, saving the final construction to a file), type:

```
python main.py --help
```
